# Maze Generator

This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through the implementation of a Q-Learning algorithm in a maze-solving agent. 
The agent learns to navigate through mazes by making optimal decisions based on exploration and reward-based learning. 
Additionally, a maze generator script creates diverse mazes, enhancing the agent's learning environment and providing varied testing scenarios.
Overall, this project offers a platform for exploring the mechanics of RL and its applications in dynamic problem-solving.
